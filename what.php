                        <p>We define a high impact experience as one that provides a higher level of learning and development, including real skill and personal development, opportunities to test new ideas, and the ability to apply lessons learned to future opportunities and endeavors. As you consider whether your experience is high impact, consider these factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Did you engage beyond a cursory, or surface level, with this experience?</li>
                            <li>- Were you challenged through the experience?</li>
                            <li>- Did you have an opportunity to get hands-on through the experience?</li>
                            <li>- Were you able to connect the dots between this activity and either real world application or how it will benefit you in the future?</li>
